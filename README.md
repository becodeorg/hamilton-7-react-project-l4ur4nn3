# [Weather App](https://fantastic-naiad-c96e39.netlify.app/)
**by [Becode](https://github.com/becodeorg)**  
  
This project was created to make us use the following elements:  
* React
* JS(X)
* APIs ([GeoApi](https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities/), [OpenWeatherMapApi](https://openweathermap.org/appid))

## Which languages were used?

React, JS(X), & Tailwind for the CSS.

## What was the easiest part ?
* Once I understood everything, it wasn't hard to progress, it was even fun, this and the Tailwind part, because it always feels good to create beautiful and functional things.
* Asking for help. For this project I had no difficulty to reach other people for help.

## What was the hardest part ?
* The beginning. I was completely lost, I felt like I knew nothing. I followed a tutorial, starting to feel better, and then I was lost again. I had to follow a few tutorial because I couldn't create a schema to follow all by myself. After that, I had to write down my code on paper to analyze what I did and only at this point everything made sense. I had no difficulty to work with Unsplash API but I had to reach that point to have a "declic", so it feels kinda very late in the project to me.
* Helping people. I had troubles explaining to anyone else what I understood because my words aren't precise enough, and I felt like I am hard to understand. It made me feel kinda bad because I really wanted to help but I feel like I couldn't. It was also hard to go back to my own project after helping others without feeling very selfish.
* The deployment. I was working with Parcel and there was no possibility to deploy without errors. After 2 days I remade it on Vite and it worked like a charm. It was a minor difficulty tho, it didn't restrain me, I could still work on my project meanwhile.

## Additional notes
In the ressources files, you can find a pdf with my manual notes, code and the tutorials I followed.
